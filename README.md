# cra-template-learn

Create React App template to learn Web Development with Tailwind.

## Goals

This template is a slimmed down version of the default CRA template with Tailwind built in. The template is best suited for people wanting to learn Web Development by focusing on setting up a single page without any unnecessary best practices like testing, PWA and device specific optimizations. The following documentations are useful to learn the basics needed to work with this template.

- [React](https://reactjs.org) Documentation
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) Documentation
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) Documentation

## Requirements

To get started with Web Development install [node](https://nodejs.org) and an editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Installation

Open a Terminal and type the following:

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-learn
```

Then move into the folder with the app that was just created using `cd my-app` and start the development server by running `npm start`. `my-app` can be replaced with the desired name for your application.
